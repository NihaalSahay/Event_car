                <p class="bodydr">“Panch Parmeshwar” is basically like a panchayat where the people in the villages are asked to solve their disputes based on the discussion between two groups and the decision is taken by a team consisting of six members where 5 members are called panch and one is the sarpanch. This type of thing is being practiced in the most of the villages and is very popular among the villages.</p>
